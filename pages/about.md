## About the Meridian History Collection

In 2021, care of the Meridian History Collection transferred from the former Meridian Historical Society to the Meridian Library District. The materials are now part of our collection and are located at Meridian City Hall.

Meridian Library District is working to digitize Meridian historical collections in an effort to preserve, document, and make available the history and culture of the area. 

Initial digitization work began in 2022 and was made possible by a SHARP Operations Grant through the [Idaho Humanities Council](https://www.idahohumanities.org/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. Funding for this grant has been provided by the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) as part of the American Rescue Plan.
